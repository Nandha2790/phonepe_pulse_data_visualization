# phonepe_pulse_data_visualization
## Project Overview

This project provides interactive data visualizations and insights into PhonePe's business trends using data from the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository. By leveraging Python libraries like pandas, Streamlit, Plotly, and SQLAlchemy, along with a MySQL database, users can explore various metrics related to transaction volume, types, and geographical distribution.

## Key Functionalities

### Data Extraction and Transformation (ETL):
- Extracts data from the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository (instructions provided below).
- Applies necessary data cleaning and transformation steps.
- For detailed information on specific functions or configurations, refer to the provided Python scripts [main.ipynb].
- Feel free to modify the project to suit your specific needs and customizations.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Analyzes data trends and patterns to identify key insights.
- Cleans and prepares data for visualization.

### Interactive Dashboard:
- Built with Streamlit for a user-friendly web interface.
- Presents data visualizations using Plotly's geo maps, bar charts, pie charts, and other effective visualizations.
- Offers interactive filters and controls to refine visualizations based on user selections.

### Technologies Used

1. Python
2. pandas
3. MySQL Connector/Python
4. pymysql
5. Plotly (for interactive visualizations)
6. Streamlit (for web app development)
7. SQLAlchemy (for database interactions)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites:
- Install Python and the listed libraries.
- Set up a MySQL database server

### Data Acquisition:
- Clone the PhonePe Pulse repository from GitHub (https://github.com/PhonePe/pulse).
- Place the cloned repository in the same directory as this project

### Settingup Instructions
- Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone (https://github.com/Nandha2790/phonepe_pulse_data_visualization)

### Running the Application
- Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
- Run the application using the command streamlit run app.py.
- Access the Streamlit app in your web browser by opening the link displayed in the terminal (usually http://localhost:8501).

### Interactive Dashboard

The Streamlit app provides an intuitive interface to explore PhonePe Pulse data. Users can interact with various features:

- **Filters:**
   - Select specific timeframes (e.g., year, quarter) for a more focused analysis.
- **Visualizations:**
    - Explore trends using interactive charts and maps.
    - Gain insights into transaction volume, types, and geographical distribution.
- **Customization:**
    - Utilize interactive elements to customize and drill down into specific data points for deeper understanding.

### Future Enhancements

- **Predictive Modeling:**  Explore the possibility of developing models to predict future trends or user behavior based on historical data.
- **Real-time Data Integration:** Integrate real-time data feeds from PhonePe Pulse to provide the most up-to-date insights.
